# DENEME

This repository contains a simple tower defense game implemented with Tkinter.

Run the game with:

```
python3 tower_defense.py
```

Place towers by clicking on grid cells that are not part of the path. Enemies will move along the path in the middle of the screen. Prevent them from reaching the end to preserve your lives.
