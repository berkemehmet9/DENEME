# DENEME

This repository contains a simple tower defense game now implemented with Kivy so it can run on mobile devices.

Run the game with:

```
python3 tower_defense.py
```

You can build the game for Android using Buildozer or for iOS using Kivy's toolchain. On desktop, you can simply run the command above.

Place towers by touching grid cells that are not part of the path. Enemies will move along the middle of the screen. Prevent them from reaching the end to preserve your lives.
